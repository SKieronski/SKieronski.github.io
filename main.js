//Default game mode will be easy
//Initialize global variables
let seriesN = 1;

//Setup array of key objects
//Number of objects will be equal to the game mode selected
//objects will have a key name, audio src, and randomly assigned color.

//Setup keys as new buttons and add to empty div? Can just start with keys in the div and manipulate those.

//add code to play a series of notes starting with 1 note
//player will have to copy the series each time it is played
//Need code logic to give the player time to press the right keys.
//Once player presses the right keys, next series of notes will be played.
//Is this where async timing comes into play? For giving the player a time limit.

//add event listeners to each key
//check if the right key was pressed
//when the key is pressed it plays the associated audio.
